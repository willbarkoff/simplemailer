SimpleMailer is a program that is used to send emails with SMTP. To use it create a config.toml file, an addresses.txt file, and a templates/ directory.

The `config.toml` file should have the following format:
```toml
FromAddress = "barry@starlabs.com" # the email address to send from
FromDisplay = "Barry Allen <barry@starlabs.com>" # the email address and name to display in sent mail
SMTPHost = "smtp.starlabs.com" # the SMTP server
SendDomain = "starlabs.com" # the domain to send from
SMTPPort = 587 # the port to use with SMTP
SMTPUsername = "barry@starlabs.com" # the SMTP username
SMTPPassword = "superSecret1!" # the SMTP password
```

The `addresses.txt` file should be a list of email addresses, with one per line. For example:
```
caitlin@starlabs.com
cisco@starlabs.com
ralph@starlabs.com
iris@cccitizen.com
joe_west@ccpd.centralcity.gov
ceclile.horton@centralcity.gov
```

The `templates/` directory should contain a folder for each message template to send. Each of those folders should contain a `subject.txt` file used for the subject of the email, a `template.txt` file for the plaintext version of the email, and a `template.html` file for the HTML version of the email. Any files included in the `templates/` directory will be included in the templates. You can use go's [`text/template`](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) templating language to write templates. As of right now, there is no way to pass values to the templates, but I hope to add that soon.
